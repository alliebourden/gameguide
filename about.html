      <h3>Discover & Play</h3>
      <p id="about">In 2023 I was accepted into the Get Coding mentorship program through TechNL. This program allows individuals to re-skill into the tech industry by learning the tools and skills needed by current developers. Students are paired with a local mentor to guide them through each module.

      GameGuide was developed as my module one project using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. This application uses API data to allows users to view the top trending games, sort them by name or year, and then view further details on their choosen game.
      <br>
      <!-- <br>
      With so many games to choose from it can sometimes feel overwhelming. I know that when I look at games to add to my collection, I often think about who I am playing the game with, or how much time I'd like to spend playing a particular game. It's my hope that using the GameGuide will assist users in their choice, and maybe even discover their new favourite game along the way! -->
