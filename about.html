      <h3>Discover & Play</h3>
      <p id="about">This website was built as my first project for the Get Coding program. The goal was to complete a website using HTML, CSS and JS. As an avid player of all games, in this case boardgames, I wanted to create a website that would help users choose a game to either play or purchase. And so, GameGuide was created!
      <br>
      <br>
      With so many games to choose from it can sometimes feel overwhelming. I know that when I look at games to add to my collection, I often think about who I am playing the game with, or how much time I'd like to spend playing a particular game. It's my hope that using the GameGuide will assist users in their choice, and maybe even discover their new favourite game along the way!
