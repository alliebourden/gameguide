# GameGuide - Get Coding Module 1 Project

## Introduction

In 2023 I was accepted into the Get Coding mentorship program through TechNL. This program allows individuals to re-skill into the tech industry by learning the tools and skills needed by current developers. Students are paired with a local mentor to guide them through each module.

## Module One Project

The first module of the Get Coding program involves creating a simple web-based application. The completion of this module has allowed me to apply a variety of entry-level web development skills such as:

- Setting up and managing projects using github/vscode.
- The habit committing and pushing code frequently.
- Creating a simple web app using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
- A strong understanding of JS and programming logic in preparation to use ES6, React.js or Node.js.

I have a large selection of board games and I am always looking for new ones to add to my collection. I also like to keep a variety of games on hand, as the interest and skill varies depending on who I am playing with. After discovering an API I wanted to work with, I decided to create a website that allows the user to help decide on a board game they would like to play or purchase. The idea was that a user could input variables, such as player count and playtime, and once submitted, they can view suggested board games. 

## Project Obstacles

After choosing the API, I began to work on the basic HTML and CSS components of the application. As a graphic designer, I felt comfortable developing the foundations of the application to work with the data I would receive from the API. Learning JavaScript was my biggest learning curve, but soon enough I had built a small amount of functionality to access my API data and begin fleshing out much of the JS.

Unfortunately, it was at this point the API I would using shut down by the developers. This was a major set back for myself and the project, but I looked at it from the perspective of if I was an actual developer, knowing flexibility and changing priorities were not uncommon. With the guidance of my mentor, we found a new API, albeit with less API endpoints to work with, and we modified the vision of GameGuide.

## GameGuide

With a new API to work with, the idea behind GameGuide was updated. Instead of having users input values (# of players, mechanics, so on), now the user is presented with a list of the top trending games, and there they can click to learn more about the game.

The index page has general introduction, and using the navigation bar the user can navigate to the other sections. "About" gives a more concise introduction to the application. "GameGuide" is where users can view the top trending games, sort them by name or year published. Then the user can choose a game they are interested in and navigate to a "Game Details" page to learn more about that game. "Contact" page has a form that users can submit their comments and I receive to my email through a third-party application.
