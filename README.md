# GameGuide - Get Coding Module 1 Project

## Introduction

In 2023, I joined the Get Coding mentorship program, facilitated by TechNL. This program offers individuals an opportunity to reskill themselves for the dynamic tech industry by equipping them with the essential tools and skills demanded by today's developers. As part of this program, students like me are paired with local mentors who provide guidance through each module.

## Module One Project

For the first module of the Get Coding program, I was tasked with creating a straightforward web-based application. The completion of this module enabled me to apply a range of foundational web development skills, including:

1. Setting up and managing projects using github/vscode.
2. The habit committing and pushing code frequently.
3. Creating a simple web app using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
4. A strong understanding of JS and programming logic in preparation to use ES6, React.js or Node.js.

Personally, I have a collection of board games and am always on the lookout for new additions. I enjoy having a diverse selection of games available, as the interests and skill levels of players can vary. After discovering an board game focused API, I decided to create a website that allowed users to make informed decisions about which board game to play or purchase. The concept was to allow users to input variables such as player count and playtime, and then receive suggestions for board games based on their preferences.


## Project Obstacles

After choosing the API, I began to work on the basic HTML and CSS components of the application. As a graphic designer, I felt comfortable developing the foundations of the application to display with the data I would receive from the API. My most significant challenge was learning JavaScript, but soon enough I had built functionality to access my API data and begin learning how to manipulate the data for my web application.

Unfortunately, it was at this point the API I was working with was shut down by the developers. This was a set back for myself and the project, but shortly after I identified a new API, albeit with fewer endpoints to work with, and adjusted the vision for GameGuide accordingly.

## GameGuide

With the introduction of a new API, GameGuide underwent a change. Instead of having users input specific values like the number of players and game mechanics, the updated GameGuide presents users with a list of the top trending games. Here, users can add their favorite games to a local library and access detailed information about individual games.

The index page provides a general introduction to the application, and users can navigate to other sections using the navigation bar. The "About" section offers a concise introduction to the application's purpose, while "GameGuide" allows users to explore the top trending games, sorting them by name or year of publication. Users can select a game of interest and navigate to a "Game Details" page by clicking "Learn More" to see more of that game's information. Alternatively, users can "like" as many games as they wish and view their liked games on the "Liked Games" page. The "Contact" page features a form where users can submit their comments, which I receive via email through a third-party application.
