# module-one-project

In 2023 I was accepted into the Get Coding mentorship program through TechNL. This program allows individuals to re-skill into the tech industry by learning the tools and skills needed by current developers. Students are paired with a local mentor to guide them through each module.

The first module of the Get Coding program involves creating a website using HTML, CSS and JS. I have a large selection of boardgames and I am always looking for new ones to add to my collection. I also like to keep a variety of games on hand, as the interest and skill depending on who I am playing with. I have decided to create a website that allows the user to help decide on a boardgrame they would like to play or purchase. The user can input variables, such as player count and playtime, and once submitted, they can view suggested board games.
